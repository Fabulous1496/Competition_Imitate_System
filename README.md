# Competition_Imitate_System
Hello,everyone!🙋‍♂️\n
This is a project about a imitation system of a virtual speech competition.
Here are some background information:
Each turn of this competition has 12 competitors.
There are two rounds.
In round one, all players will be divided into two groups.
10 judges will give them a score, and the player's final score is the average after ignoring the highest and the lowest.
In each group, the 1st🥇, 2nd🥈, and 3rd🥉 player can compete in round 2.
And after the same process, the 1st🥇, 2nd🥈, and 3rd🥉 player would be rewarded and recorded!🎆
You can veiw the records of the previous winners.
This system may be used for gambling among friends as an alternative to coin tossing.😆
